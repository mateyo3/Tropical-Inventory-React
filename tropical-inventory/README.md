# [React Inventory]
Project Title:  Tropical Flooring Iventory Management System (TFIMS) - Simple, Beautiful, Powerful, 
https://github.com/vmov031/react-inventory.git

## TFIMS is a customized inventory management software for tracking inventory levels, orders, sales and deliveries for a hardwood flooring wholesale distributor. TFIMS was built with the specific needs of Tropical Flooring in mind. The major functionalities of TFIMS can be seen below: 
    
    Individual login (authenticated user) 
    Dashboard - displays highlights and key metrics
    Inventory - list of actual inventory database as well as a search bar
    Orders - allows you to receive incoming and send out inventory orders
    Stock control - Allows you to transfer stock from 1 location to the next (updates inventory stock levels)

    TFIMS was built with the goal of improving the inventory and warehouse management process of Tropical Flooring. It would replace the manual inventory tracking with an intuitive, straight forward and simple system that all employees could learn
